      Movie Description
      </h2>
      <p>Set on a colorful Greek island, the plot serves as a background for a wealth of ABBA songs. A young woman about to be married discovers that any one of three men could be her father. She invites all three to the wedding without telling her mother, Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep), who was once the lead singer of Donna and the Dynamos. In the meantime, Donna has invited her back-up singers, Rosie Mulligan (Dame Julie Walters) and Tanya Wilkinson (Christine Baranski)<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795421/plotsummary/?ref_=tt_stry_pl" target="_blank" id="paragraphlinks">......</a></p>

      <h3>
       The fictional island of Kalokairi
      </h3>

      <p>Where is This paradise?</p>
      <p>The location in question, known as Kalokairi in the film, was the Greek island of Skopelos. One of the Sporades, it sits pretty off the eastern shore of the mainland and was largely known for its abundance of plums until, in summer 2007, Hollywood arrived. While the sequel saw filming take over the Croatian island of Vis for six weeks, the cast and crew stayed just seven days on Skopelos a decade ago – but they took in enough of its rugged beauty to turn it into a newly hot destination, complete with a discreet but signposted Mamma Mia! trail.<a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/where-was-mamma-mia-filmed" target="_blank" id="paragraphlinks">......</a></p>

      <h4>Thank You For The Music</h4>
      <p>
        "If you listen closely to the lyrics of these songs, they do tell a story,” Sezniak said. "Judy Cramer (producer), Catherine Johnson (book) and Phyllida Lloyd (director) did such a beautiful job of constructing the story that you forget that the music came first. It was Cramer who got it in her head that there was a musical in ABBA's songs.

      <h4>Beautiful Greece</h4>

      <p>Eye-catching landscapes; crystal clear waters next to golden coasts; traditional Pelion architecture; rugged natural landscapes and pure island atmosphere are what Skopelos adds up to. As the island’s land is mostly covered by a pine forest, the colour green will definitely cast a spell over you. 
        
        It is part of the Sporades island group and it has three ports: Skopelos, Agnontas and Glossa. Its ancient Greek name was Peparithos, son of Dionysus and Ariadne, who is believed to have been the island’s first inhabitant, while its name today was given in Ptolemaios texts in the 2nd c. AD.

<h3>Mamma Mia and Me</h3>
  <p>
I've loved this movie since the day I watched it on cable televison with my family. Its funny, colourful and filled with music and dance accompanied by a crazy storyline. Abba also holds a special place in my heart since I heard it on the radio a lot growing up and its always bought me comfort. 
I hope you love this movie as much as I do.
